<h2 class="center">Gameplay</h2>
<p>As Poz, you are able to take control of your enemies and use their different abilities and skills to your advantage. You will start with being able to possess one enemy and at the end you will be able to possess 4 at a time. Everytime you possess a new type of enemy, a pop up menu will come up and show you how to play that enemy. To beat the game, the player must decide which kind of possessed enemies work best together and against the enemies they are fighting at this point of the game. The player also must level up their enemies to gain new skills and abilities.</p>
